T3D function

Puts a 3D-border arround any control. This border has 2 levels: outer border and inner border.
The border can be raised, inset or mixed, filled and not filled. It works only on a normal (standard)
forms, with the backcolor RGB(192, 192, 192)

Syntax:

T3D Form, Control, Bevel, [Style], [Filled]


The T3D function syntax has these named arguments:

Part	Description:

Form		The form where you want to have a 3D-control. The form must be in ScaleMode = 3 (Pixel)
		and AutoRedraw = True.

Control	The actual control to put in 3D. If you want a control in another form, you have to specify this.
		Example: Form2.Label1 

Bevel	The distance between the inner and outer border.

Style		(Optional)The style of 3D, as described in settings. If you omit Style, it will be set to 0 (RaiseRaise).

Filled	(Optional) Filled between the inner and outer border, as described in settings. If you omit Filled,
		it will be set to 0 (no fill).


Settings

The Style argument settings are:

Constant			Value			Description

T3dRaiseRaise	0				Inner raised and outer raised
T3dRaiseInset		1				Inner raised and outer inset
T3dInsetRaise		2				Inner inset and outer raised
T3dInsetInset		3				Inner inset and outer inset
T3dNone			4				No border at all

Note   	These constants are specified in the Subroutine.  As a result, the names
		can be used anywhere in your code in place of the actual values.


The Filled argument settings are:

Constant			Value			Description

T3dF0			0				Not filled	
T3dF1			1				Filled

Note   	These constants are specified in the Subroutine.  As a result, the names
		can be used anywhere in your code in place of the actual values.


Examples:

T3D Form1, Label1, 20, T3dRaiseRaise, T3dF0 
T3D Form1, Label2, 8, 0, T3dF1
T3D Form1, Text1, 3, T3dRaiseInset
T3D Form2, Form2.text1, 5, T3dInsetInset, T3dF1 

You can acces the routine with a variabele, but there will be no return-value.

a = T3D(Form1, Label1, 20, T3dRaiseRaise, T3dF0)
